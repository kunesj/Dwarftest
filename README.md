# DwarfTest

Tool for converting Dwarf Fortress map into Minetest map


## Known Issues

### "List of block materials has invalid length! Try to restart Dwarf Fortress."

Restarting Dwarf Fortress should fix this. If anyone knows why it happens, please tell.

### Everything is in shadow

Running `\fixlight (0,0,0) (1000,1000,1000)` in Minetest should fix that.

## Development Resources

#### Dwarf Fortress
